[拦截器`Interceptor`无法修改`@ResponseBody`的响应头](https://www.cnblogs.com/nuccch/p/7891634.html)，因为`postHandle`晚于返回响应。可以通过过滤器`Filter`或者`@ResponseBodyAdvice`修改。

> Note that `postHandle` is less useful with `@ResponseBody` and `ResponseEntity` methods for which a the response is written  and committed within the `HandlerAdapter` and before `postHandle`. That means its too late to make any changes to the  response such as adding an extra header. For such scenarios you can implement `ResponseBodyAdvice` and either declare it as  an Controller Advice bean or configure it directly on `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter`.
